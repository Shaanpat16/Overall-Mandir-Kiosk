# Activities Images Folder

This folder contains images for each activity program displayed in the kiosk.

Each activity has its own folder with space for **1 image**:

### Activities:
1. **balbalika/** - Bal/Balika (Children's Activities, Ages 5-11)

## 📸 How to Add Images:

For each activity folder:
1. Add **1 image** named `1.jpg` or `1.png`
2. Recommended size: 800x600px or larger
3. The image will display at the top of the activity popup when users click on that activity

## 💡 Tips:
- Use high-quality photos that represent the activity
- JPG or PNG format
- Images will be displayed at a maximum height of 300px
- If no image is found, the popup will display without an image (graceful fallback)

## 🎨 Where They Appear:
When users click on an activity card in the "Our Activities" section, a popup opens showing the activity details with the image displayed at the top.
