# Welcome Screen Video

Add a video file for the welcome screen background.

## Required Video:
- **Filename:** `welcome-video.mp4` (or `welcome-video.webm`)
- **Recommended:** 
  - Resolution: 1920x1080 (Full HD) or higher
  - Format: MP4 (best compatibility) or WebM
  - Duration: 10-30 seconds (will loop automatically)
  - File size: Under 50MB for fast loading
- **Content Ideas:**
  - Drone footage of the mandir
  - Time-lapse of temple activities
  - Slow pan around architecture
  - Peaceful scenes from events

## Tips:
- Video will autoplay, loop, and be muted
- Darker/slower videos work best for readability
- Test that text remains readable over video
- Compress video to keep file size manageable

## How to Add:
1. Save your video as `welcome-video.mp4`
2. Place it in this folder (`/public/videos/`)
3. Refresh the kiosk to see it

## Fallback:
If no video is found, the gradient background will display instead.
